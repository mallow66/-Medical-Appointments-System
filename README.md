# Medical-Appointments-System


## Overview

For medical patients, secretary and doctors who works and visits the doctor's office, MyDoc is a
mobile and web solution that manages and schedule the medical appointments to facilitate the work for the
secretary and for the patients and ask for recommendations from the doctor using a chat platform;
unlike the traditional way by using the phone to ask for an appointment or visit the place itself for
seeing the doctor.

Here is a sample story board of the main purpose of this system :

##  Problem Scenarios, Alternatives and Value Propositions: 

### Problem Scenarios : 

- The secretary must remind
every patient one day before
their appointments, which is
very difficult for her she got to search the phone
number of the patient, call it
and remind it.

- The patient doesn't have an
application or a platform to
take an appointment easily,
which is painful


- Its hard to the patient to stay
connected with his doctor (for
example if he wants to ask
some simple questions about
the medication that he takes)



### Current alternatives : 

- she got to search the phone
number of the patient, call it
and remind it.
In the case where the patient
didn't respond, she got to recall
it later.

- the patient must visit the
doctors office to fix the
appointment(spend around 2
hours), or call the secretary by
phone (spend around 15 min)
sometimes the phoneâ€™s office is
busy, so the patient got to try
many times

- call the doctor's office, the
secretary will respond and see
if the doctor is available, if he is
not, the patient must call later... 


### Value Propositions : 
- The patients receive
notifications on their phone
automatically.
The patient can manage the
settings of how the
notifications would be
received...

- The patient can browse all the
doctor's office timetable
appointment, look to the
appropriate time for him and fix
the appointment without the
need of any contact with the
medical secretary

- A new way to stay connected
with the doctors :
Patient can chat with their
doctors on the
platform/mobile solution

# Medical-Appointments-System


## Overview

For medical patients, secretary and doctors who works and visits the doctor's office, MyDoc is a
mobile and web solution that manages and schedule the medical appointments to facilitate the work for the
secretary and for the patients and ask for recommendations from the doctor using a chat platform;
unlike the traditional way by using the phone to ask for an appointment or visit the place itself for
seeing the doctor.
